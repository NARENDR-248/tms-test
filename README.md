## TMS - Front End




## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed (version x.x.x)
- Git installed

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Installation

1. Install Node.js: If you haven't already, you can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
  

3. Change your working directory to the project root:
   cd project name
4. Install Global PNPM:
We recommend using PNPM as the package manager for your Next.js project. To install PNPM globally, run:
```bash
 npm install -g pnpm

```
 
4. Install Dependencies:
Now, install the project's dependencies using PNPM. In your project directory, run:
```bash
 pnpm install

```
This command will install all the required dependencies specified in the package.json file.

5. Run the Project:
```bash 
  pnpm dev

```
Your Next.js application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.


<!-- First, install the packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
``` -->

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
